# AWS Account Post-ESE539

After the course concludes, we will remove all AWS permissions from your account. After conclusion, you will lose read and write permissions on all AWS resources including instances, S3 buckets and cost explorer.

If you wish to regain these permissions or to use this AWS account for a different class, you must follow the procedure outlined in [Removing an AWS Account from an Organization](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/organizations/latest/userguide/orgs_manage_accounts_remove.html). This procedure can take up to a few months to process. **Do not start this process until final grades are in. We will be unable to grade your work unless you are a part of the organization** You must add additional billing information and will be responsible for any AWS costs occured after you regain access to your account.
